# 🌩️ WeatherGuard AI  
## AI-Based Weather Data Integrity System

WeatherGuard AI is an AI-powered weather data validation system that detects anomalies, sensor failures, tampering, and suspicious patterns in weather datasets using Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques.

The system combines:
- Isolation Forest (Machine Learning)
- LSTM Autoencoder (Deep Learning)

to identify both point anomalies and sequential weather pattern abnormalities.

# 📌 Overview

Weather data plays a critical role in:
- Agriculture
- Aviation
- Disaster Management
- Climate Research
- Smart Cities

However, weather systems are vulnerable to:
- Sensor failures
- Missing or corrupted data
- Cyber attacks
- Data manipulation

WeatherGuard AI validates incoming weather data and detects suspicious activity automatically using AI models trained on historical climate data.

🤖 AI Models Used
1. Isolation Forest
Detects:
Outliers
Sudden spikes
Corrupted values
Point anomalies

2. LSTM Autoencoder
Detects:
Sequential anomalies
Pattern deviations
Subtle tampering
Sensor inconsistencies

The LSTM model learns normal weather behavior and flags abnormal sequences using reconstruction error thresholds.
